              When you tap "Find a Rival", FitForge matches you by intensity, timezone,
              and preferred exercises so you aren't paired with a ghost or mismatch. Our
              algorithm considers your skill level, workout preferences, and availability to
              connect you with someone who will push you to perform your best.

              Global hotspots light up around the clock: NYC night-owls burning midnight
              calories, Hong Kong early birds starting their day with squats, London
              lunch-break warriors, and LA sunset sessions. No matter when you're ready,
              there's someone across the world ready to battle.

              People show up more when someone is counting on them. By connecting you

              workouts can't match. Every battle is a commitment to yourself and your
              opponent—no ghosting, no excuses, just results.
